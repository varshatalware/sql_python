1. where clause =
comparison operator - =,!=,<,>,<=,>=
logical operator- and, or
arithmatic  operator - +,-,*,/,%
in and not in operator     (,,)
between and not between   --and--
like operator   -%
2. order by=

-=-----==------===-----
delete =
it is used to delete the data from table row by row
cannot delete the structure
delete table_name where col_name=condition


drop =
it is used to delete table data as well as table structure
it is used to delete the database
drop table table_name
drop database database_name


truncate =
it is used to delete the records from the table.
cannot delete the structure
can not delete the data row by row
truncate table table_name


update=
it is used to update column data or specific data if condition is provide
update table_name set col_name=value where col_name =condition
eg update info set loc = pune where name = rani;


alter=
alter is used to perform operation on columns
by using alter we can add,delete,chage data type,increase decrese size of columns
alter table table_name add col_name
alter table table_name drop col col_name
alter table table_name alter col col_name 


aggregate functions
min
select min(salary) as new_sal from info

max
select max(salary) as new_sal from info

sum
select sum(salary) as newsal from info

count
select count(*) as newcount from info
select count(loc) from info

top
select top 3 * from info
select top 4 salary from info order by asc/desc

avg
select avg(salary) as avgsal from info

distinct
this function is used to find unique record from column
select distinct (salary) from info
select distinct (dept) from info
select count(distinct(dept))from info


constraints=

primary key
not null + unique
used for numeric values for create table
create table student (id int primary ke,---)

not null
if u define not nill constraint on col then u cant insert null value in it
written on create table
create table student ( ------, name varchar () not null,  age int not null)


unique
it ensures that all the values in colm should be unique or different value
create table student (id int unique, name varchar(10) not null,-------)


check key
it ensures that all values in a colm satiosfies a specific condition
it is just like a condition checking before inserting data into column
eg. create table info ( id int, name varchar(10) not null unique,age int check( age >18))


foreign key
only connect with primary key
null value allowed


auto increment
it will automatically insert or increment the unique value into table once u define the auto increment
it will allow u to specify the range of values by which u want to create a unique values
col_name identity(start, diff)
eg. create table info( id int not null unique identity (1,1),name varchar(10), loc varchar(10));

.

default
set default value to colm when value is not defined
eg
create table info(id int primary key, name varchar(10),city varchar(10),age int, loc varchar(10) default 'nashik');



group by clause

select col_name ,agg function(col_name) from table_name where col_name(condition) group by col_name
eg. select dept, sum(salary)as deptsal from info group by dept

select name,min(salary)  as newsal from info where age > 20 group by name


q.ans.select top2 salary from info group by dept order by salary desc 


having clause
having clauseis added in sql because where clause not used with aggregate function
select col_name,agg function(col_name) from table_name where col_name(condition) group by col_name having agg function (col_name)operator value
eg.select department, sum(salary) from employee where sum(salary)  >70000 group by department having sum(salary) > 70000;

to identify duplicate value
select id,name,loc,dept,salary,count(*) from employee group by id,name,loc,dept,salary having count(*)>1;


set operator

union
union all
intersept
except


datetime
select getdate();
select getdate()-1;
select getdate()+1;
